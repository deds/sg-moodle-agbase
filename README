A local plugin for providing tools to integrate Moodle with Khan Academy clones

This is a beta release and has been tested on Moodle 2.1.1.

This serves as a base plugin that exposes some parameters or functionality
for other Moodle-KA clone plugins to use.  This is not of much use if used on
its own.

Copy the agbase directory under your moodle install's local directory.
Once installed and enabled there is an administration link present inside the
"Site Administration" block under "Plugins -> Local plugins".
